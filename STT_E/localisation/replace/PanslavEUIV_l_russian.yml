 flavor_steppe.8.d: "In 1618, the Torghut and a small contingent of Dörbet Oirats chose to migrate from the upper Irtysh River region to the grazing pastures of the lower Volga region south of Saratov and north of the Caspian Sea. The Torghut were led by their taishi, Kho Orluk. They were the largest Oirat tribe to migrate, bringing along nearly the entire tribe. The second-largest group was the Dörbet Oirats under their taishi, Dalai Batur. Together they moved west through southern Siberia and the southern Ural Mountains. En route, they raided Russian settlements and Kazakh and Bashkir encampments."
